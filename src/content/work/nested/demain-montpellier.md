> Demain-Montpellier

I had the pleasure of working on the Demain Montpellier Association website, where I was responsible
for the entire design and branding process. From the initial conception to the final product, I was dedicated
to ensuring that the website reflected the values and mission of the association.

I worked closely with the association's team to create a visually stunning website that was also highly 
functional and user-friendly. I developed the layout, selected the color scheme, and chose the typography
to ensure that the website was aesthetically pleasing and engaging.

In addition to the design work, I also developed the website's branding, including creating a logo and establishing
a consistent brand identity. I wanted the website to be memorable and recognizable, and I worked hard to ensure 
that the brand was consistent across all of the website's pages.

Overall, I am incredibly proud of the work that I did for the Demain Montpellier Association website.
I believe that my contributions will have a significant impact on the association's outreach and engagement,
and I am excited to see the positive results of my efforts.
